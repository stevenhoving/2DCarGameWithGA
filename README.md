# 2D Car Game With Genetic Algorithm

This is a 2D Car Game written C++ with Qt. 

The game is a topview game, where you have to go through a generated car track, and collect 100 rewards through reward gates. You can play alone, or against a learning genetic algorithm. Find out who learns the track faster. You can visualize only the genetic algorithm either.

## Fun facts
* You can hide the track, and try to go through it by only using a lidar
