# 2D Car Game With Genetic Algorithm

This is a 2D Car Game in c++ with Qt. 

The game is a topview game, where you have to go through a generated car track, and collect 100 rewards through reward gates. You can play alone, or against a learning genetic algorithm. Find out who learns the track faster. You can visualize only the genetic algorithm either.
